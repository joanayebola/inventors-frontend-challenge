## Challenge Description

You are tasked with building a web page that displays a list of movies from an external API. The API endpoint is `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular`, which returns a list of popular movies. Your task is to create a frontend that consumes this API and displays the movies in a visually appealing way.

## Requirements

Below are some basic requirements that should be implemented in your submission:

- Your frontend should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The web page should display a list of movies, including the movie poster, title, release date, and overview.
- The list should be sortable by release date or popularity.
- The web page should have a search bar that allows users to search for movies by title.
- When a user clicks on a movie, it should display a modal that shows additional details, such as the movie's rating, runtime, and genre.
- Your frontend should be responsive and work on desktop and mobile devices.

**Note:** You are free to use any CSS framework or library to help you build the UI (user interface). Also, you can add any other functionality you feel is necessary, but avoid adding complicated functionalities.
